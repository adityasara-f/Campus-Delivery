I made and deployed my first ever actual python project.

As a part of the python course in my first semester of my cs degree, we were tasked to create a full fledged python based project. The mandates were simple: it should have the involvement of an admin role, it should equip a database and it should serve a purpose. 

Our (Our = Utkarsh, my team member) idea was to tackle a real problem all fellow VITians face on a daily basis, coordinating online dliveries (amazon, flipkart, etc..) with "annas" whose voice seems to be more broken than the McDonald's ice cream vending maching in the US. We came up with a simple system to coordinate all those deliveries by giving the delivery partners the option to create pre set slots for pickup/return according to their availability, and for the students to be able to select the slot they will be free in, instead of having to silence a random call during a lecture and hiding under the desk to answer and say "anna I am in a class". 

This is just a prototype, proving the concept, the real version is still an "if/maybe/when" but a "surely". For more details, please check out the GitHub repository.
